## Installation

```bash filename="Terminal" copy
npm i annotative-code
```

Duh, we are done! This will install the Annotative Code web component, as well as the [language functions](https://github.com/highlightjs/highlight.js/tree/main/src/languages)
and [themes](https://github.com/highlightjs/highlight.js/tree/main/src/styles) from highlight.js.

Next, head out to
[`<annotative-code />`](/getting-started/annotative-code),
[`<annotative-code-common />`](/getting-started/annotative-code-common) or
[`<annotative-code-full />`](/getting-started/annotative-code-full) for your choice.
