## Introduction

Welcome to **Annotative Code**! Built on top of [highlight.js](https://github.com/highlightjs/highlight.js),
Annotative Code lets you add interactive input knobs into your code demo, so that it is **playable** but safe (not using `eval()`).
Moreover, changes made by the users can be captured and reflected to the demo.
