- `annotation` is the config object that specifies what to be and how to annotated
  - the object key(s) is used to match for the placeholder enclosed with \_\_\_\_ (4 underscore)
  - the object value(s) contains detail of how to annotate
    - perhaps to provide further explaination ([`description`](#))
    - or perhaps to let users play around with that field (built-in [`type`](#) and additional [`knob`](#))
    - you can also specify predefined values to be selected ([`options`](#)) ...and more!
  - In the following example, we define an `annotation` that
    - match for <code style={style}>\_\_\_\_{props.placeholder}\_\_\_\_</code> inside `content`
    - replace it with annotation popup that let users play around with the available options <code style={style}>{props.options}</code>
